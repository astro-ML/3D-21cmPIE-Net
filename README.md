# 3D-21cmPIE-Net

'3D 21cm Parameter InfErence Network'

Repository for reproducing the results from [Arxiv Link].

3D-21cmPIE-Net is trained to jointly infer astrophysical and (warm) dark matter parameters, as well as astrophysical parameters alone, from 3D lightcones of the 21cm signal during reionization and the cosmic dawn. This repository also provides further functionalities such as an interface to 21cmFAST for lightcone creation (incl. mock observed lightcones for noise levels derived by 21cmSense), for network training and evaluation, as well as for network interpretation via saliency maps.  

Installation
------------
1. Clone this repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/stef-neu/3D-21cmPIE-Net.git
    cd 3D-21cmPIE-Net
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies (installation with conda is recommended)

  - with `conda`:
    ```
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate 3D-21cmPIE-Net
    ```
  - with `pip`:
    ``` 
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
    ```

    Note: For installation on MacOS (less tested, tensorflow CPU), please replace 'tensorflow-gpu' by 'tensorflow' in environment.yml and setup.py, or for pip-based installation in requirements/requirements.txt

3. Install `3D-21cmPIE-Net`

  ```
  python3 -m pip install .
  ```
  
4. When using `runSimulations.py`, `create_mocks.py` or `SaliencyMaps.py` install [21cmFAST][21cmFAST] 3.1.2

5. When using `SaliencyMaps.py` install [tf-keras-vis][tf-keras-vis]

[21cmFAST]: https://github.com/21cmfast/21cmFAST
[tf-keras-vis]: https://github.com/keisen/tf-keras-vis
[21cmSense]: https://github.com/jpober/21cmSense

Usage
-----
1. Produce a dataset by default saved to `simulations/output` with a size of N lightcones. It is recommended to not produce large datasets with a single run. runSimulations.py creates a new output file for each run.
    ```
    cd simulations
    python runSimulations.py [options] [N_lightcones]
    ```
    Folders 'simulations/output' and 'simulations/_cache' are created. 
    
A. Train the 3D CNN on bare simulations:
   - Train the neural network in `3DCNN`. By default this takes all output files from runSimulations.py as input.
       ```
       cd 3DCNN
       python runCNN.py [options] [epochs]
       ```
        
B: Train the 3D CNN on opt mocks:
  - Create opt mocks in `mock_creation`.
    ```
    python create_mocks.py [options]
    ```
  - Train the neural network in `3DCNN`. Here the input files have to be specified.
    ```
    python runCNN.py --data=../mock_creation/output/*.tfrecord [options] [epochs]
    ```
The trained 3D CNNs and test results from the paper are stored in paper_results. The code to reproduce the plots from the paper can be found under paper_plots. This code uses the data from paper_results.
